# Learning to Love the Terminal



Article: [How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love the Terminal – Pablo Stanley](https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/how-i-stopped-worrying-and-learned-to-love-the-terminal-c8914be0e306)



### Why I Found It Interesting



This article shows how a designer shifted from traditional visual tools like Figma to working directly in the terminal using AI-powered CLI tools. I found it interesting because it challenges the idea that the terminal is only for developers and highlights how conversational AI can make technical workflows more accessible.



It also connects design and development more closely by allowing designers to build real, working prototypes instead of just visual mockups.



### Comment by Andy Liu

I find it quite surprising that the author, as a designer, shifted from tools like Figma to the default macOS Terminal for his work. Even with the rise of AI, I would expect most designers to stay with whatever tools they have always been using, but now AI-powered. I wonder if CLI tools will become more mainstream amongst designers down the line, or if they will stay niche.
