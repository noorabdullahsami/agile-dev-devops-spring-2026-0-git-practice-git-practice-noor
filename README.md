### Why I Found It Interesting



This article shows how a designer shifted from traditional visual tools like Figma to working directly in the terminal using AI-powered CLI tools. I found it interesting because it challenges the idea that the terminal is only for developers and highlights how conversational AI can make technical workflows more accessible.



It also connects design and development more closely by allowing designers to build real, working prototypes instead of just visual mockups.
